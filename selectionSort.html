  <p>
    The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by finding the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array,
    and placing it at the end of the sorted section of the array. The algorithm uses two sub arrays within the given array.
    The worst case time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2), it is not effective for large data sets.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The sub array maintained at the start of the array is sorted from arr[0] to arr[i]</li>
    <li>The other elements in the array are unsorted, elements arr[i +1] through arr[arr.length -1]</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Each time the algorithm iterates through the unordered sub array, finding the smallest element and placing it
    at the end on the sorted sub array.
